Hi, I’m **Andy Chang**, a sophomore majoring in **Computer Science**.  
I’m deeply interested in **backend development**, **data mining**, and **fintech**, and I enjoy exploring how technology can make systems more intelligent and efficient.

Beyond academics, I find balance through **fitness**, **reading**, and **writing**, which help me stay focused and creative.  
I value **discipline**, **long-term thinking**, and **logical reasoning**, and I’m driven by the desire to keep learning and improving.

I believe growth is a continuous journey — and I’m building mine **one line of code at a time.**
